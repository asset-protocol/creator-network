# Install Asset Protocol

`@asset-protocol/react` works with [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) on the following operating systems:

- macOS darwin 64-bit (Intel), ARM 64-bit (Apple Silicon)
- Linux 64-bit, ARM 64-bit
- Windows 64-bit, ARM 64-bit

## Install Per Repository

You may wish to pin the version of Asset Protocol used within a repository, especially [if you are
collaborating with other developers](../docs/core-concepts/remote-caching). In that case, add `@asset-protocol/react` as a dev dependency at the root
of the repository:

`bash npm install @asset-protocol/react --save-dev `

`bash yarn add @asset-protocol/react --dev --ignore-workspace-root-check`

`bash pnpm add @asset-protocol/react --save-dev`
